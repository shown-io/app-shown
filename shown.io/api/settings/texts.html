Our free plan is completely free if you connect your ad accounts. However, you will have to pay your advertising budget on the different ad channels (Google, Facebook or Microsoft).","pricing_answer_3":"If you don't have existing ad accounts, Shown will create them for you automatically. In this scenario, you will have to credit your Shown account with your advertising budget. It will then be used to pay your clicks on the different channels (Google, Facebook & Microsoft).","pricing_answer_4":"Online success depends on many different factors such as your product or service, market, pricing, website responsiveness, etc. Providing a sales guarantee is therefore impossible.\n\nWhat we can guarantee is best-in-class marketing offering high-quality traffic, which will lead to sales if other factors standards are met.","pricing_answer_5":"Yes. We are charging a service fee of 20% of your advertising budget if you ask Shown to create all of your ad accounts. Having only your Shown account to handle all your ads is a huge time-saver & offers better cross-channel results in the long term.","pricing_answer_6":"Defining a single monthly budget is not possible. Every business has different advertising goals and is competing in different markets. What we can advice from the experience of our thousands of clients, is to start with a minimum of 150\u20ac\/month. Lower budgets won't allow any optimisation, nor leave space & time for notifiable results. Keep in mind that advertising budgets can be adjusted at any time. Many customers are starting small and increase their ad budget over time when they start seeing results.","pricing_answer_7":"Only if you activate auto payments. Shown will then charge you automatically when you Shown balance is reaching zero.","pricing_answer_8":"Yes, by default you need to add your Shown credits (advertising budget) manually. Once you feel comfortable, you can activate auto-payments, which will automatically credit your Shown account when your credits (advertising budget) reach zero.","pricing_answer_9":"You can downgrade your plan at any moment & get back to our free plan. Shown credits won't be charged if auto-payment is disabled. \n\nWe care about customer satisfaction and trust. So you can always contact us at support@shown.io if you have any other question.","pricing_answer_10":"Premium plans payments can be refunded within 15 days after selection. \n\nYou cannot ask for a refund of used Shown credits, as they were already consumed to show your ads to potential clients.","credits_question_1":"How does Shown Credits work?","credits_answer_1":"Shown Credits is a feature that allows you to pay your advertising budget directly through Shown. You don't need ad accounts as we will automatically create them for you. This simplifies even more the process of campaign creation, while having a greater control over how much you spend on your different ads & channels. To use Shown Credits, simply select \"Use Shown Account\" during campaign creation on the respective platforms. Note that this is a paid feature. 20% fee will be taken on your advertising budget if you choose to work with Shown accounts.","credits_question_2":"Can I refund the Shown Credits?","credits_answer_2":"Yes, you can ask for a refund of your remaining balance at any moment.","credits_question_3":"You offer free campaign management but when I create a campaign I have to choose a budget. So is it free or not?","credits_question_4":"Can I launch ads without using Shown Credits?","credits_question_5":"My ads are being paused if I'm exceeding the amount added as Shown Credits?","credits_answer_3":"We can understand your confusion. Our free plan will create your first ad campaign for free (if you link you existing ad accounts) but you still have to pay Google, Microsoft, and Facebook for the clicks you want to receive. We offer a free service, but you still have to decide & pay your advertising budget. You will only pay when people click on your ads. Traditional agencies charge people an extra fee to offer the service of setting up & optimizing ads.","credits_answer_4":"Yes, Shown Credits are optional. you can still launch ads on any platform without adding Shown Credits. Note that this is possible only by linking your own Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter accounts. By doing so, the spending will be managed directly by the ads platforms. If you choose to link your account to the ads platforms the credit card details are hidden from us. We work closely with ad platforms to optimize ads and they only give us access to campaign parameters, not to your billing information.","credits_answer_5":"No, if the added credits are exceeded & your campaigns are still enabled, we will automatically top-up by charging the default payment method. You can pause your campaigns at any moment if you want to stop advertising.","subscriptions_answer_1":"There is no catch.
